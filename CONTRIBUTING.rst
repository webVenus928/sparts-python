Contributing to sparts
======================
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

Our Development Process
-----------------------
sparts is maintained and developed in the open, on github.  It's designed
to be easily extensible and to contain common APIs for rapid development
of other projects, which may reside in separate repositories as necessary.

In general, if a task or module is generic enough, it should be in sparts.
Unit tests are strongly encouraged and should be included with your pull
requests.  Case classes to make testing even easier to write are provided
with the sparts source code.

Send us your pull requests, and we'd be happy to provide feedback and merge
as appropriate.

Pull Requests
-------------
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`. 
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation. 
4. If your bugfix or feature is significant, update `CHANGES.txt` for the
   unreleased revision
5. Ensure the test suite passes. 
6. Make sure your code lints (e.g., pyflakes, PEP8, etc) 
7. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").
