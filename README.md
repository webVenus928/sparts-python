There is a lot of boilerplate and copypasta associated with building
services (or any other software that runs continuously and does things)

sparts is a python library that aims to eliminate as much of the boiler
plate as possible, making it as dead simple to write new services with
little to no code.

Design Goals
============

* Be able to implement services using sparts with as little code as possible
* Support as many RPC transports as possible (thrift, http, dbus, etc)
* Make it painless to integrate services that require custom IO loops
  (twisted, tornado, glib, etc)

HOWTO
=====

A sparts service typically consists of two parts, the "service" definition, and
its tasks.

Service
-------

`sparts.vtask.VService` - This is the meat of any service implemented on sparts.

Simply put, just subclass VService, and run initFromCLI() and you are done.

For example, myservice.py:

```python
from sparts.vservice import VService
class MyService(VService):
    pass

MyService.initFromCLI()
```

Now, you can run this file with python -h (to see the available options), or run with:
`python myservice.py`

You should the following:
```
DEBUG:VService:All tasks started
```

And pressing ^C will emit:
```
^CINFO:VService:KeyboardInterrupt Received!  Stopping Tasks...
INFO:VService:Instance shut down gracefully
```

This is pretty damn useless.  That's where Tasks come into play

Tasks
-----

`sparts.vtask.VTask` - This is the base class for all tasks

Tasks are what trigger your program to take action.  This action can be
processing periodic events, handling HTTP requests, handling thrift requests,
working on items from a queue, waking up on an event, operating some ioloop,
or whatever.

Here's a simple example of a service with tasks (requires tornado installed):

```python
from sparts.vservice import VService
from sparts.tasks.tornado import TornadoIOLoopTask, TornadoHTTPTask

class MyService(VService):
    ALL_TASKS=[TornadoIOLoopTask, TornadoHTTPTask]
    DEFAULT_PORT=8000

MyService.initFromCLI()
```

Now running it emits:
```
> python myservice.py --http-port 8000
INFO:MyService.TornadoHTTPTask:TornadoHTTPTask Server Started on 0.0.0.0:8000
DEBUG:MyService:All tasks started
```

And as you can see, you can curl the webserver:
```
> curl localhost:8000
Hello, world
```
